# hello-world
First coding project
I am a technology lawyer who wants to learn coding. I think it will be a useful skill, as I work with engineers on a routine basis and am interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence and all things technology. I also think that it is good to have as many tools in your toolchest as possible. So, I am bravely exploring this new world of coding. We shall see where the adventure leads!
